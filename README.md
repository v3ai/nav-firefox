motivation: Need to switch from google to firefox because I dont want to poison my brain with ads from youtube

This is a navigation script to make it easier to search the internet

keys "j" and "k" navigate up and down through results, and "o" will open
the result in a new tab

This is for firefox while using google's search engine

go to "about:debugging" in the firefox search bar, my firefox, load temp extension, find the manifest.json file, and it should work
